## Cleaning up

When you're done, destroy the app deployment:
<!-- doctest command -->

```console
adapt destroy movieapp
```

<!-- doctest output { matchRegex: "Deployment movieapp stopped successfully." } -->

This will stop and remove all the app's Docker containers.

## Next Step

Next are some more in-depth resources on Adapt for you to explore.
