## Requirements

To install and use Adapt, you must have Node.js installed:

| Requirement | Installation Instructions |
| --- | --- |
| [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) (versions supported: 10-13) | [Installing Node and npm](../user/install/requirements.md#nodejs-with-npm) |

Additionally, this Getting Started Guide also requires [Docker](https://docker.com).
You'll need **one** of the following:

| Requirement | Installation Instructions |
| --- | --- |
| A Linux system with Docker | [Installing Docker on Linux](https://docs.docker.com/install/#server) |
| A MacOS system with Docker Desktop for Mac | [Installing Docker Desktop for Mac](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/install/) |

:::note
If you're using Docker on Linux, you'll need to either run all `docker` commands as superuser (`root`) or ensure your user is part of the `docker` group.
For instructions and more information, see the Docker [Linux post-install instructions](https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/linux-postinstall/).
:::

Docker is correctly installed if the command `docker ps` does not show any errors.

Lastly, certain commands assume you're using the `bash` shell.
If you use a different shell, you may need to adjust some commands slightly.

## Installing Adapt

To install the `adapt` CLI globally:

<!-- doctest command -->
<!--DOCUSAURUS_CODE_TABS-->
<!--npm-->

```console
npm install -g @adpt/cli@next
```

<!--yarn-->

```console
yarn global add @adpt/cli
```

<!--END_DOCUSAURUS_CODE_TABS-->

<!-- doctest output { matchRegex: "\\+ @adpt/cli@" } -->

:::note
Depending on how your `npm` or `yarn` installation is set up, you may need root or administrator privileges to install a module globally.

If you get an `EACCES` error from `npm install` or see any other errors related to insufficient permissions you may need to retry the command with administrator privileges (e.g. with `sudo`).

<details>
<summary>Alternately, if you'd rather not install Adapt globally, you can run Adapt using npx (click to expand)</summary>

As an alternative to installing `adapt` globally, you can use `npx` instead.
To use Adapt via `npx`, any time you see an `adapt` CLI command in this guide, simply substitute `npx @adpt/cli` instead of `adapt`.
For example, if this guide asks you to run this command:

```console
adapt new blank
```

You would instead type:

```console
npx @adpt/cli new blank
```

The rest of this guide will assume you have installed `adapt` globally using `npm install -g`.
