## Adapt Starters

Adapt starters are the easiest way to set up a complete app development environment from scratch.
To use an [official starter](https://gitlab.com/adpt/starters), just use the name, like this:

```bash
adapt new hello-react-node-postgres
```

Or for any other starter, you can specify it using a URL, a published NPM package reference, or [any of the other ways to specify an NPM dependency](https://docs.npmjs.com/files/package.json#dependencies):

```bash
adapt new git+https://github.com/myusername/mystarterrepo
```

Available starters include:

* hello-react-node-postgres

    A Hello World starter that includes a React user interface (made with create-react-app), a Node.js API back end, a Postgres database, a static web server, and a URL router.

* hello-node

    A Hello World starter that just includes a Node.js API back end.

* moviedb-react-node

    The complete MovieDB app from this guide.

* blank

    A minimal starting point for creating an Adapt-enabled project.

* [Official Adapt starter repos on GitLab](https://gitlab.com/adpt/starters)
